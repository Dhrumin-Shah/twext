# twext
text/tweet(searching!) using twilio+twitter's API!

make sure you have node.js, express, bodyparser, twilio, & twit installed. These are key to running the program. Once you get your API keys from twitter & twilio, simply just plug them in!

the command when texting SMS to the twilio number is: search {searchiteminserthere}

good luck. hi@samayshamdasani.com
